intro_paragraphs:
  - "I am a Stanford PhD student working on computer vision and machine learning. I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href=\"https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/\">Serena Yeung-Levy</a> and to be supported by the <a href=\"https://www.quadfellowship.org/\">Quad Fellowship</a>."
  - "I work on vision-language models: evaluation, agentic systems, and training environments. I often apply these methods to biology and medicine, and to questions about how AI can advance science."
