Theme: 
- To use a bespoke css theme, put it in `themes/`, like `themes/panaroma.css`, then go to `index.md` ana set `theme: panorama` then I think you need to set something in `_config.yaml` as well.

Viewing it in the browser or whatever:
```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
